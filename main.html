    <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    <p>
        My motivation for becoming a software developer is rooted in a passion for problem-solving and a desire to build things that matter. I am fascinated by the way code can transform complex ideas into functional, elegant solutions. The constant challenge of debugging, the satisfaction of creating something from scratch, and the ability to have a tangible impact on the world through technology are what truly excite me. I want to be part of a field that is always evolving, where there is endless opportunity to learn, innovate, and contribute to the digital landscape.
